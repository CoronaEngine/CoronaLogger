## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in CoronaLogger:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainers with details to allow us to reproduce and assess impact.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and provide a timeline for fixes when possible.

When a fix is available, we may publish a security release and update the documentation accordingly.
